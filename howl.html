    <h1> Bacon and Eggs</h1>
    <p class="movie">From Howl's Moving Castle (2004)</p>
    <p class="desc"> I'm sure everyone who has watched or has not watched the movie already knows this breakfast dish. But the secret ingredient to make it tastier is a hot, dramatic wizard to cook it withâ™¡... or just serve it with a slice of bread and a cup of tea. </p>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the bacon strips in a frying pan over medium heat and cook them until crispy on both sides. Let the bacon fat grease the pan to prevent sticking when the eggs are added.</li>
    <li>Have Howl crack the eggs into the pan and feed the eggshells to Calcifer. Let the eggs cook until the whites are set and the yolks reach your preferred consistency. For a cloudy yolk, cover the skillet with a lid to cook them evenly from the top.</li>
    <li>Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper for added flavor.</li>
    <li>Serve the crispy bacon and cooked eggs hot on a plate, accompanied by a piece of cheese, a slice of bread, a steaming cup of tea, and a hot blondie.</li>
