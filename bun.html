    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Prepare the red bean paste by either following your favorite recipe (leftovers can be frozen for future use) or using store-bought paste. Ensure it’s completely cooled before using.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water. Add the active dry yeast, stir, and let it sit for about 15 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
      <li>Stir lukewarm milk into the yeast mixture, then add the flour, powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt. Knead the dough by hand or with a dough hook until it is soft, smooth, and no longer sticky.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
     <li>Prepare six 3” x 3” squares of parchment paper for the buns to sit on during steaming.</li>
    <li>Roll the red bean paste into six balls, approximately 35g each, and cover them with a damp towel to keep them from drying out.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a disc, place a red bean paste ball in the center, and wrap the dough around the filling, pinching the edges to seal.</li>
    <li>Set up your steamer with about 5 cups of warm water. Place each bun, seam-side down, on a parchment square in the steamer. Leave at least 1 inch of space between buns. Let them proof for 30 minutes inside the steamer without turning on the heat.</li>
    <li>After proofing, turn the heat to medium-high and steam the buns for 15 minutes with the lid tightly closed. Do not open the lid during this time.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and let the buns sit in the steamer for an additional 5 minutes with the lid still covered. Afterward, carefully remove the lid, and your steamed red bean buns are ready to enjoy!</li>
